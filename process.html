<!-- STEP 1 -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>1. Requirement Understanding</h2>
  <p>
    We begin by working closely with your hiring stakeholders to gain a clear understanding
    of the role, required technical skills, experience level and team dynamics.
  </p>
  <p>
    This step ensures alignment on expectations, timelines, and success criteria before
    sourcing begins.

<!-- STEP 2 -->

  <h2>2. Targeted Talent Sourcing</h2>
  <p>
    Our recruiters source candidates from a focused network of technology professionals,
    leveraging internal databases, referrals, and role-specific talent channels.
  </p>
  <p>
    This targeted approach helps us reach candidates who are relevant, available, and
    aligned with your hiring needs.
  </p>

<!-- STEP 3 -->

  <h2>3. Technical & Behavioral Screening</h2>
  <p>
    Every candidate goes through a structured screening process that evaluates technical
    competencies, problem-solving ability, communication skills, and role suitability.
  </p>
  <p>
    This ensures that only qualified and job-ready candidates are submitted for client
    interviews.

    process.
